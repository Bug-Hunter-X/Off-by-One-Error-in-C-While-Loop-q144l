This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C programming. The `bug.c` file contains code with the error, while `bugSolution.c` provides the corrected version. The error arises from the loop condition and how the variable `i` is incremented and used in the summation.  Understanding this helps avoid similar errors in more complex loops.
